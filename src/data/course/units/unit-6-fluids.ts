Pumps in parallel add flow rates at the same head. This is analogous to electrical circuits: series = more "voltage" (head), parallel = more "current" (flow).

For the same fluid (ν_m = ν_p), these give contradictory velocity requirements. Achieving both simultaneously would require a model fluid with ν_m = ν_p × (L_m/L_p)^(3/2), which is practically impossible for most scale ratios.
