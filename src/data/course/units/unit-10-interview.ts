So f_n is proportional to (thickness/L^2). A thin, long bracket with a heavy load will have a low natural frequency that could coincide with foot traffic or nearby machinery.

Applying the packing fraction: count = 0.64 x (room volume / sphere volume). For a typical room (4x5x3 m) with 10 mm bearings, this yields roughly 73 million.

          explanation: 'ISO 31000 (Risk Management — Principles, Framework, and Process) provides a generic, high-level framework that any organization can adapt. It defines principles (integrated, structured, inclusive), a framework (leadership, integration, design, implementation, evaluation, improvement), and a process (communication, scope, assessment, treatment, monitoring, recording). Unlike industry-specific standards (ISO 14971 for medical devices, ISO 12100 for machinery safety, API 580 for risk-based inspection), ISO 31000 does not prescribe specific tools (FMEA, FTA, HAZOP) or acceptance criteria. Organizations use ISO 31000 as the overarching framework and industry standards for specific risk assessment methodologies.',

            'They are the same technique with different names',
            'Crashing adds resources (overtime, additional staff) to critical path tasks to reduce their duration; fast-tracking performs normally sequential tasks in parallel to reduce total schedule, accepting increased risk of rework',

          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation: 'Crashing: add resources to shorten critical path tasks. Example: assign two engineers instead of one, authorize overtime, hire subcontractors. Trade-off: increased cost, diminishing returns (adding people to a late project can make it later — Brooks\'s Law). Fast-tracking: overlap tasks that were planned sequentially. Example: begin tooling fabrication before design is fully finalized; start integration testing before all modules are complete. Trade-off: increased risk of rework if upstream tasks change outputs, coordination complexity, potential quality issues. Both techniques target only critical path tasks — compressing non-critical tasks does not help the overall schedule.',

          acceptedAnswers: ['HAZOP', 'hazop', 'Hazop', 'HazOp'],
          explanation: 'HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) study is a structured technique for identifying hazards and operability problems in process plants. A multidisciplinary team systematically applies guide words to each process parameter (flow, temperature, pressure, level, composition) at each node in the process flow diagram. Example: "No Flow" in a cooling water line → overheating → reactor runaway. For each deviation, the team identifies: causes, consequences, existing safeguards, and recommended actions. HAZOP is required by many regulatory frameworks (OSHA PSM, Seveso Directive) for high-hazard chemical processes. It was developed by ICI in the 1960s and is now standard practice worldwide.',
