          question: 'Taylor\'s tool life equation is VT^n = C. For a carbide tool cutting steel, typical n values are around 0.25. If cutting speed increases from 150 to 200 m/min, by what factor does tool life decrease?',

          ],
          correctIndex: 2,
          explanation: 'From VT^n = C: T₂/T₁ = (V₁/V₂)^(1/n) = (150/200)^(1/0.25) = (0.75)^4 = 0.316. So T₂ = 0.316 × T₁, meaning tool life decreased by a factor of 1/0.316 ≈ 3.16. Wait — let me recalculate: (150/200)^4 = 0.75^4 = 0.3164. Tool life ratio = 1/0.3164 ≈ 3.2. Actually checking: a factor of decrease of 3.2× means the new life is ~31.6% of original. The high sensitivity of tool life to speed (due to the exponent 1/n = 4) is why cutting speed is the most impactful machining parameter.',

          acceptedAnswers: ['nose', 'Nose', 'tip', 'Tip', 'corner', 'Corner'],
          explanation: 'The theoretical arithmetic average roughness in turning is approximately Ra ≈ f²/(32 × r), where f is the feed per revolution and r is the tool nose radius. A larger nose radius or smaller feed produces a better finish. This is why finishing passes use small feeds (0.05–0.15 mm/rev) and tools with large nose radii (0.8–1.6 mm). In practice, actual roughness is affected by BUE, vibration, and material properties.',

          explanation: 'DMLS/SLM uses a high-power laser to fully melt and fuse metal powder layer by layer. It can produce fully dense metal parts in titanium, Inconel, stainless steel, and aluminum alloys. It is the dominant metal AM process for aerospace (complex topology-optimized brackets, fuel nozzles) and medical (custom implants with porous surfaces for osseointegration). Build rates are slow and cost is high, but the geometric freedom and material properties justify it for high-value parts.',

          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation: 'Draft angles (typically 1–3° per side) prevent the part from gripping the mold core as the plastic shrinks during cooling. Without draft, ejection requires excessive force, causing part deformation, surface scratching, or even breakage. Textured surfaces require additional draft (add 1° per 0.025 mm texture depth). Designing with zero draft dramatically increases mold cost because side-actions or collapsible cores are needed.',

          question: 'In sheet metal design, the minimum recommended inside bend radius for most ductile metals is equal to the material thickness (1T bend radius).',
          correctAnswer: true,
          explanation: 'For most ductile sheet metals (mild steel, aluminum 5052, copper), a minimum inside bend radius of 1T (one material thickness) is a safe general rule that prevents cracking on the outer surface. Harder or less ductile materials may require 2T–4T or more. The bend radius also depends on grain direction — bending perpendicular to the rolling direction allows tighter bends. For critical applications, always consult the material supplier\'s bend radius recommendations.',

          explanation: 'At 10,000 units/year with complex geometry and tight tolerances, injection molding is the most cost-effective process if the material can be plastic. The high tooling cost ($10k–$100k+) is amortized over many parts, giving very low per-part costs ($0.5–$5). 3D printing is too slow and expensive per part at this volume. Sand casting lacks the tolerance capability. CNC machining could work for metal parts but is expensive per piece at this volume.',

          explanation: 'Deep, narrow pockets require long, slender end mills that deflect under cutting forces, causing poor surface finish, dimensional errors, and potential tool breakage.

A UV laser traces each layer\'s cross-section on the surface of a liquid photopolymer resin vat, curing it.
