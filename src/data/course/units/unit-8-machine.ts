          question: 'In a fillet weld loaded in shear parallel to the weld axis, the critical stress plane is at 45° through the throat of the weld (the shortest dimension across the triangular cross-section).',
          correctAnswer: true,
          explanation: 'The throat dimension of a fillet weld (a = 0.707 × leg size for equal-leg fillets) is the shortest distance from the root to the face. Failure occurs on this 45° throat plane because it has the smallest cross-sectional area. The shear stress on the throat is τ = F/(a × L), where a is the throat dimension and L is the weld length. This is the basis of all fillet weld strength calculations in AWS D1.1 and Eurocode 3. The allowable shear stress on the throat is typically 0.3 × ultimate tensile strength of the electrode.',

It occurs when tensile stress acts perpendicular to the adhesive layer, typically at the edges of lap joints. Adhesives are very weak in peel compared to shear — a thin adhesive layer under peel acts like opening a zipper. Good adhesive joint design maximizes shear area and minimizes peel: use scarfed or stepped joints, add fillets at edges, or design lap joints with balanced stiffness to reduce eccentricity.',

          explanation: 'Preload (also called pretension or initial clamping force) is the tension in the bolt created during tightening. It compresses the clamped members, creating a friction force that resists joint separation and slip. Proper preload is critical: too low allows joint separation or slip under load, too high risks bolt yield. The preload is controlled during assembly by torque, angle-of-turn, or bolt stretch measurement. For critical joints, ultrasonic bolt stretch measurement provides ±1% accuracy.',

Let me recalculate: k = Gd⁴/(8D³N_a) = 80×10³ × 5⁴/(8 × 30³ × 8) = 80000 × 625/(8 × 27000 × 8) = 50,000,000/1,728,000 ≈ 28.9 N/mm. Hmm — checking with spring index C = D/d = 6: k = Gd/(8C³N_a) = 80000 × 5/(8 × 216 × 8) = 400000/13824 ≈ 28.9 N/mm.

It corrects the simple torsional shear stress (τ = 8FD/(πd³)) for two effects: direct shear stress and the stress concentration due to coil curvature. The inner fiber of the coil carries higher stress than the outer fiber. For C = 6, K_w ≈ 1.25, meaning actual peak stress is 25% higher than the simple calculation. Springs with small C (tight coils) have larger correction factors and are harder to manufacture.',

          correctAnswer: true,
          explanation: 'At low pressures, the O-ring seals through the initial squeeze (typically 10–30% compression) that creates contact stress against the mating surfaces. As system pressure increases, it pushes the O-ring against the downstream groove wall and contact surface, increasing the sealing force — this is the pressure-energized (self-energizing) effect. At high pressures (>10 MPa), back-up rings are needed to prevent the O-ring from extruding into the clearance gap. The Parker O-Ring Handbook is the standard reference for O-ring groove design.',
