# PART A: LEARNING EXPERIENCE DESIGN

---

## 1. Core Learning Loops

### 1.1 Single Question Loop

```
TRIGGER:    User selects or is presented a question
ACTION:     Read question -> Select answer / Write response -> Submit
REWARD:     Immediate correctness indicator + XP popup + explanation reveal
REINFORCE:  "Interview Insight" panel shows WHY interviewers ask this,
            what they evaluate, and how a top answer differs from an average one.
```

**Detailed Flow:**

| Step | UI Element | Duration | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1. Question Presented | Card with topic badge, difficulty indicator, question type icon | -- | Confidence slider appears: "How sure are you?" (1-5 scale) |
| 2. User Attempts | Answer input (varies by type) | Untimed by default; timer visible in Interview Sim mode | No peeking at hints unless requested (costs XP) |
| 3. Submit | Confirm button with micro-animation | -- | Disabled until answer is provided |
| 4. Result Reveal | Green pulse / amber pulse / red pulse on card border | 0.8s animation | Partial credit shown for partial answers |
| 5. Explanation | Expandable panel below question | User-controlled | Three tabs: "Quick Answer" / "Deep Explanation" / "Interview Insight" |
| 6. Confidence Calibration | Small badge: "Good call!" or "Overconfident" or "You knew more than you thought!" | 0.5s fade-in | Only appears if user set a confidence rating |
| 7. XP Award | Floating XP number rises from card | 1s animation | Amount varies by difficulty, correctness, and confidence calibration |
| 8. Next Action | "Next Question" button + optional "Add to Review" bookmark | -- | Auto-advances after 3s in speed modes |

### 1.2 Session Loop

```
TRIGGER:    User starts any session type
ACTION:     Warm-up (2 easy) -> Core Challenge (variable) -> Cool-down Review -> Summary
REWARD:     Session completion XP bonus + session stats card + achievement checks
REINFORCE:  "Session Insight" -- what improved, what to revisit, streak update
```

**Detailed Flow:**

| Phase | Purpose | Question Count | Difficulty |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Warm-up | Build confidence, activate prior knowledge | 2 questions | Easy (topics user knows) |
| Ramp-up | Transition to challenge | 1-2 questions | Medium (mixed) |
| Core Challenge | Primary learning zone | 3-10 questions (varies by session type) | Adaptive (targets 65-75% success rate) |
| Cool-down | Reinforce key takeaways | 1-2 questions | Medium-easy (revisit missed concepts from session) |
| Summary | Reflect and plan | -- | N/A (review screen) |

### 1.3 Daily Loop

```
TRIGGER:    App open / push notification at user's preferred time
ACTION:     Daily Challenge (unique curated set) -> Regular practice -> Progress check
REWARD:     Streak maintenance + daily XP bonus + progress graph update
REINFORCE:  "Daily Snapshot" -- 3 numbers: streak count, questions today, accuracy today
```

**Flow:**
1. **Open app** -> "Welcome back" with streak count prominently displayed
2. **Daily Challenge available** -> Highlighted card at top (3-5 curated questions, unique each day)
3. **Complete Daily Challenge** -> Earn "Daily Complete" badge for the calendar, streak increments
4. **Optional continued practice** -> Any session type, contributes to daily stats
5. **Progress check** -> Automated at session end: "This week you've improved in [Topic] by X%"

### 1.4 Weekly Loop

```
TRIGGER:    Monday / first app open of the week
ACTION:     Weekly Review prompt -> Weak area recovery -> Milestone check -> Topic unlock
REWARD:     Weekly summary report + milestone achievements + new content access
REINFORCE:  "Weekly Report Card" -- visual progress across all topic areas
```

**Flow:**
1. **Week start** -> "Weekly Focus" recommendation based on past week's performance
2. **Mid-week** -> Subtle nudge if weak areas haven't been practiced: "Your [Topic] skills could use a refresh"
3. **Week end** -> Weekly Report: topics practiced, accuracy trends, time invested, XP earned
4. **Milestone check** -> If a topic crosses a mastery threshold, celebrate and unlock next tier
5. **Topic unlock** -> New advanced subtopics or question formats become available based on demonstrated competence

## 2. Adaptive Progression Model

### 2.1 Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

**Inputs:**
| Signal | Weight | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Recent accuracy (last 10 questions in topic) | 0.35 | Percentage correct |
| Response time vs. expected time | 0.15 | Ratio (actual / expected) |
| Confidence calibration accuracy | 0.15 | Correlation between confidence and correctness |
| Streak within topic (consecutive correct) | 0.15 | Count |
| Historical accuracy in topic | 0.10 | Lifetime percentage |
| Session performance trend | 0.10 | Slope of accuracy over last 3 sessions |

**Difficulty Levels:** 1 through 10 (mapped to display as Easy 1-3, Medium 4-6, Hard 7-9, Expert 10)

**Adjustment Rules:**

```
IF recent_accuracy > 0.80 AND confidence_calibration > 0.70:
    difficulty += 1 (cap at 10)

IF recent_accuracy > 0.90 AND streak >= 5:
    difficulty += 2 (cap at 10)

IF recent_accuracy < 0.50:
    difficulty -= 1 (floor at 1)

IF recent_accuracy < 0.35 AND confidence_was_high:
    difficulty -= 2 (floor at 1)
    flag_topic_as_weak()

IF response_time_ratio > 2.0 AND answer_correct:
    difficulty stays (user is struggling but getting there)

IF response_time_ratio < 0.5 AND answer_correct:
    difficulty += 1 (too easy, user is breezing through)
```

**Target Zone:** The system aims for a 65-75% success rate per session. This is the "desirable difficulty" sweet spot -- challenging enough to learn, not so hard as to frustrate.

### 2.2 Topic Selection Algorithm

**Weighted Random Selection per question slot:**

```
topic_weight = base_weight
             * weakness_multiplier      // 1.0 (strong) to 3.0 (weak)
             * recency_decay            // 1.0 (not seen recently) to 0.3 (just practiced)
             * spaced_repetition_due    // 2.0 (overdue) to 0.5 (not yet due)
             * user_preference_boost    // 1.2 (user favorited) to 1.0 (neutral)
             * interview_relevance      // 1.0 to 1.5 (high-frequency interview topics)
```

Topics are selected probabilistically based on these weights. Even strong topics appear occasionally to maintain knowledge.

**Topic Categories with Sub-topics:**

| Category | Sub-topics (examples) |
|----------|----------------------|
| Statics & Dynamics | Free body diagrams, equilibrium, friction, kinematics, energy methods |
| Mechanics of Materials | Stress/strain, Mohr's circle, beam bending, torsion, buckling |
| Thermodynamics | Laws, cycles, entropy, heat transfer modes, psychrometrics |
| Fluid Mechanics | Bernoulli, pipe flow, boundary layers, drag/lift, pump curves |
| Machine Design | Gears, bearings, fasteners, welds, fatigue, shaft design |
| Manufacturing | Casting, machining, forming, joining, tolerancing, GD&T |
| Materials Science | Phase diagrams, heat treatment, material selection, failure modes |
| Controls & Vibrations | Feedback systems, natural frequency, damping, stability |
| Engineering Economics | Time value, NPV, depreciation, break-even |
| Professional Practice | Ethics, FE/PE exam concepts, standards, safety factors |

### 2.3 Question Format Variation

The system rotates through formats to prevent pattern memorization and build diverse skills:

| Format | When Used | Cognitive Skill Tested |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Multiple Choice (4 options) | All levels | Recognition, elimination |
| Multiple Select (choose all that apply) | Medium+ | Comprehensive understanding |
| True / False with Justification | All levels | Critical evaluation |
| Numerical Entry | Medium+ | Calculation, application |
| Free Text (short answer) | Medium+ | Recall, articulation |
| Ranking / Ordering | Medium+ | Process understanding, prioritization |
| Matching (pairs) | All levels | Association, categorization |
| Scenario / Case Study | Hard+ | Analysis, synthesis, judgment |
| Diagram Interpretation | Medium+ | Visual-spatial reasoning |
| "Spot the Error" | Medium+ | Debugging, critical analysis |
| Fill in the Blank (equation) | Medium+ | Recall under pressure |
| Compare & Contrast | Hard+ | Deep understanding |

**Format Selection Rule:** Each session includes at least 2 different formats. The system tracks which formats a user excels at and which they avoid, and ensures balanced exposure.

### 2.4 Confidence Calibration System

**How it works:**
- Before answering, user optionally rates confidence: 1 (guessing) to 5 (certain)
- After answering, the system compares confidence to outcome
- Over time, a calibration score emerges

**Calibration States:**

| State | Definition | System Response |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Well-Calibrated | Confidence correlates with accuracy (r > 0.6) | "Your instincts are solid" -- slight XP bonus |
| Overconfident | High confidence on wrong answers frequently | "Challenge: slow down on [Topic]" -- serve harder questions to create productive struggle |
| Underconfident | Low confidence on correct answers frequently | "You know more than you think!" -- encouraging feedback, show mastery stats |
| Uncalibrated | No correlation (new user or inconsistent) | Neutral -- keep collecting data |

**Feedback Messages (examples):**
- Confident + Correct: "Nailed it. Your confidence was well-placed."
- Confident + Wrong: "Interesting -- you were confident here. This is a common misconception. Here's why..."
- Unsure + Correct: "You got it right! Trust your knowledge on [Topic] more."
- Unsure + Wrong: "Good instinct to be cautious. Here's the concept to review..."

### 2.5 Spaced Repetition Integration

**Algorithm: Modified SM-2 (SuperMemo 2)**

Each topic-difficulty pair has:
- `ease_factor`: starts at 2.5, adjusted per review (min 1.3)
- `interval`: days until next review
- `repetitions`: consecutive successful recalls

**After each topic interaction:**
```
IF correct:
    IF repetitions == 0: interval = 1 day
    IF repetitions == 1: interval = 3 days
    IF repetitions >= 2: interval = previous_interval * ease_factor
    ease_factor += 0.1 (capped at 3.0)
    repetitions += 1

IF incorrect:
    repetitions = 0
    interval = 0.5 days (resurface same day or next session)
    ease_factor -= 0.2 (floored at 1.3)
```

**Integration with Topic Selection:** Topics overdue for spaced repetition get a 2x weight boost in the topic selection algorithm.

## 4. Weak Topic Recovery Flow

### 4.1 Detection

A topic is classified as **Weak** when ANY of these trigger:

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Rolling accuracy (last 10 questions) | Below 40% |
| Accuracy drop | 25%+ decline from historical average |
| Consecutive wrong | 3+ incorrect in a row within topic |
| Confidence-accuracy mismatch | High confidence + wrong, 3+ times in topic |
| Avoidance signal | User skips or exits questions in this topic 2+ times |

### 4.2 Recovery Process

**Phase 1: Gentle Re-introduction (Days 1-3)**
- Reduce difficulty to one level below where user was struggling
- Serve 1-2 questions per session from weak topic (mixed in naturally, not called out)
- Use format types the user is most comfortable with
- Provide extra-detailed feedback with links to concept refreshers

**Phase 2: Structured Recovery (Days 4-7)**
- Offer a "Deep Dive" session specifically for the weak topic
- Gradually increase difficulty as user demonstrates improvement
- Introduce format variety
- Present concept summary cards before questions begin

**Phase 3: Reintegration (Days 8-14)**
- Return topic to normal rotation with standard weighting
- Monitor closely -- if accuracy drops again, return to Phase 1
- Celebrate recovery: "You've improved your [Topic] accuracy by X%!"

### 4.3 Reclassification Criteria

| Status | Criteria to Enter | Criteria to Exit |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Weak | See detection triggers above | N/A (starting state) |
| Recovering | Automatic after entering recovery Phase 1 | 5+ correct in topic at medium difficulty |
| Improving | 5+ correct at medium difficulty | 10+ questions at adaptive difficulty with 65%+ accuracy |
| Competent | Meets "Improving" exit criteria | Normal ongoing assessment |
| Strong | 80%+ accuracy over 20+ questions, multiple formats | Drops below 60% over 10 questions |

### 4.4 UI Presentation -- Motivating, Not Punishing

**Language Rules:**
- NEVER say "weak" or "failing" or "bad" to the user
- USE: "Focus Area," "Building," "Growth Opportunity," "Developing"
- Always pair a gap observation with an actionable suggestion
- Always show trajectory (improving, stable, etc.) not just current state
- Celebrate recovery prominently

## 5. Session Types

### 5.1 Quick Practice

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 5 minutes |
| Questions | 5-8 |
| Topic Mix | Adaptive (weighted toward recently studied + weak areas) |
| Difficulty | Adaptive, starts at user's current level |
| Format Mix | 80% multiple choice, 20% other quick formats |
| Scoring | Standard XP per question |
| Feedback | Immediate after each question (brief mode) |
| Timer | Per-question suggested time (30-45s), non-punitive |
| Best For | Morning warm-up, quick review, maintaining streaks |

### 5.2 Deep Dive

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 15-20 minutes |
| Questions | 10-15 |
| Topic Mix | Single topic selected by user OR recommended by system |

| Format Mix | Varied -- at least 4 different formats per session |
| Scoring | Standard XP + "Deep Dive Completion" bonus (50 XP) |
| Feedback | Detailed after each question, with concept links |
| Timer | No timer (thoroughness over speed) |
| Best For | Focused study, weak area improvement, deep understanding |

**Unique Mechanic:** "Concept Chain" -- questions build on each other. Getting Q3 right unlocks a harder Q4 that extends the same concept. Getting Q3 wrong triggers a scaffolding question that re-teaches the concept before trying a similar Q4.

### 5.3 Interview Simulation

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 30 minutes |
| Questions | 15-20 |
| Topic Mix | Mixed across 4-6 topics (mirrors real interviews) |
| Difficulty | Mixed: 30% Easy, 40% Medium, 20% Hard, 10% Expert |
| Format Mix | 40% MC, 20% scenario, 15% free text, 15% numerical, 10% other |
| Scoring | Scored out of 100 (weighted by difficulty). Graded: A/B/C/D/F |
| Feedback | DELAYED -- all feedback shown after session completes (realistic) |
| Timer | Strict per-question timer (varies by type: 30s MC, 120s scenario, 90s free text) |
| Best For | Interview readiness assessment, pressure practice |

**Unique Mechanic:** "Interview Pressure" -- a visible timer, no going back to previous questions, and a final score that tracks improvement over time. Post-session debrief is comprehensive.

**Grading Scale:**
| Score | Grade | Message |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | A | "Interview Ready -- you'd impress." |
| 80-89 | B | "Strong performance. Polish a few areas and you're set." |
| 70-79 | C | "Solid foundation. Keep practicing the topics you missed." |
| 60-69 | D | "Getting there. Focus on [weakest topic from sim]." |
| 0-59 | F | "More practice needed. Try Deep Dive sessions on [topics]." |

## 6. XP System

### 6.1 Base XP per Question

| Difficulty | Correct | Partial Credit | Incorrect (attempted) | Skipped |
|-----------|---------|---------------|----------------------|---------|
| Easy (1-3) | 10 XP | 5 XP | 2 XP | 0 XP |
| Medium (4-6) | 20 XP | 10 XP | 3 XP | 0 XP |
| Hard (7-9) | 35 XP | 18 XP | 5 XP | 0 XP |
| Expert (10) | 50 XP | 25 XP | 8 XP | 0 XP |

> Incorrect answers still give small XP to reward engagement and learning from mistakes. Skipping gives nothing.

### 6.2 Format Multipliers

| Question Format | XP Multiplier | Rationale |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Multiple Choice | 1.0x | Baseline |
| Multiple Select | 1.1x | Slightly harder |
| True/False + Justification | 1.15x | Requires reasoning |
| Numerical Entry | 1.2x | Calculation effort |
| Free Text | 1.3x | Articulation effort |
| Ranking | 1.15x | Ordering complexity |
| Matching | 1.05x | Association |
| Scenario / Case Study | 1.5x | Highest cognitive load |
| Diagram Interpretation | 1.2x | Visual reasoning |
| Spot the Error | 1.25x | Critical analysis |

**XP Calculation:** `base_xp * format_multiplier * streak_multiplier * session_bonus`

### 6.3 Streak Multipliers

| Streak Length | Multiplier |
|--------------|------------|
| 1 day | 1.0x |
| 2 days | 1.05x |
| 3 days | 1.10x |
| 5 days | 1.15x |
| 7 days (1 week) | 1.25x |
| 14 days (2 weeks) | 1.35x |
| 21 days (3 weeks) | 1.40x |
| 30 days (1 month) | 1.50x (cap) |

The multiplier applies to ALL XP earned during that session. Cap at 1.5x to prevent runaway inflation.

### 6.4 Bonus XP Triggers

| Trigger | Bonus | Frequency |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Perfect Session (all correct) | +50 XP | Per session |
| Speed Demon (avg time < 50% of expected) | +20 XP | Per session |
| Confidence Master (all confidence ratings accurate) | +30 XP | Per session |
| First Question of the Day | +5 XP | Daily |
| Daily Challenge Complete | +25 XP | Daily |
| Daily Challenge Perfect | +50 XP (replaces the 25) | Daily |
| Deep Dive Complete | +50 XP | Per session |
| Interview Sim Complete | +75 XP | Per session |
| Interview Sim Grade A | +100 XP (replaces the 75) | Per session |
| Weak Area Recovery Complete | +40 XP | Per session |
| Explorer Complete | +30 XP | Per session |
| 100 Questions Answered (milestone) | +200 XP | Once |
| 500 Questions Answered | +500 XP | Once |
| 1000 Questions Answered | +1000 XP | Once |
| Come Back After 3+ Day Absence | +25 XP ("Welcome Back") | Per return |

### 6.5 XP Sinks / Costs (Optional Mechanic)

| Action | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Request Hint | -5 XP | Reveals a hint but reduces question XP by 50% |
| Skip Question | 0 XP earned | No penalty, but no reward |
| Streak Freeze | -100 XP | Protects streak for 1 day |

### 11.3 "What's Next" Recommendation

After every session, show one smart recommendation:

**Algorithm:**
```
IF weak_topic_detected AND NOT just_did_recovery:
    recommend "Deep Dive: [weak topic]"
ELSE IF streak_at_risk (late in day, haven't hit daily minimum):
    recommend "Quick Practice to lock in your streak"

## 12. Motivational Patterns

### 12.1 Progress Visualization Approaches

| Visualization | Location | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **XP Progress Bar** | Top of every screen | Shows progress to next level, always visible |
| **Skill Radar Chart** | Home screen / Profile | Spider chart showing relative strength across all topics |
| **Streak Counter** | Home screen, top-right | Fire icon + day count, always visible |
| **Weekly Activity Bar** | Home screen | 7-day bar chart showing daily activity |
| **Monthly Heat Map** | Profile / Stats | Calendar view with intensity coloring |
| **Accuracy Trend Line** | Profile / Stats | Line graph showing accuracy over time (overall + per topic) |
| **Topic Mastery Bars** | Skill tree + home widget | Horizontal progress bars per topic |
| **Session History** | Profile / Stats | List of past sessions with scores |
| **Interview Readiness Gauge** | Home screen | Circular gauge (0-100) based on sim scores + overall mastery |

### 12.2 Micro-celebrations

| Moment | Animation / Sound Concept |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Correct answer | Card border flashes green, subtle "ding" sound, XP floats up |
| Streak continues (session start) | Fire icon pulses, counter increments with bounce |
| Question streak (3 in a row) | "On fire!" text briefly appears above question card |
| Question streak (5 in a row) | Larger "UNSTOPPABLE" text with particle trail |
| XP milestone (every 500 XP) | XP bar shimmers gold briefly |
| Returning after absence | Warm "Welcome back" with motivational engineering quote |
| Completing last question of session | Screen edges glow, "Session Complete" swoops in |

**Sound Design Principles:**
- All sounds optional (settings toggle)
- Engineering-themed: mechanical clicks, precision instrument sounds, pneumatic releases
- Subtle and satisfying, never jarring
- Different tones for different events (users learn to associate sound = outcome)

### 12.3 Social Proof Elements (Without Real Users)

Since the app may not initially have multiplayer or social features, create perceived social context:

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **"X% of engineers get this right"** | Shown after answering; simulated difficulty percentages based on question difficulty rating |
| **"This is a common interview question at [Company Type]"** | Tag certain questions with industry relevance |
| **"Top performers answer in under X seconds"** | Benchmark time after answering timed questions |
| **"Engineers who master this topic earn X% higher interview scores"** | Motivational stat on topic intro screens |
| **Daily Challenge leaderboard position** | "You scored in the top X%" (simulated percentile based on score) |

**Important:** All simulated social proof must be clearly reasonable and based on actual difficulty calibration, not fabricated to mislead. As real user data accumulates, transition to actual statistics.

### 12.4 Comeback Mechanics (Re-engagement)

**When user hasn't practiced in 3+ days:**

| Days Absent | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| 3-6 days | "Welcome back! Your streak is waiting. Jump back in with a Quick Practice." |
| 7-13 days | "We saved your progress. Here's a custom Recovery Session based on what you were working on." Show last session stats. |
| 14-29 days | "Good to see you again. A lot of engineers take breaks -- what matters is coming back. Here's a refresher session." Offer easy warm-up session. |
| 30+ days | "Welcome back, [Title]. Let's see where you stand." Offer a brief diagnostic (10 questions, mixed) to re-calibrate difficulty before resuming normal practice. |

**Comeback Bonus XP:** 25 XP bonus for first session after 3+ day absence. Stacks with other bonuses.

**No guilt mechanics:** The app NEVER says "you missed X days" or "your streak broke." It focuses on what's ahead, not what was missed.

### 12.5 "Just Right" Difficulty -- Flow State Targeting

The entire adaptive system is designed to keep the user in a **flow state** (Csikszentmihalyi's flow channel):

```
    HIGH  |         ANXIETY
          |        /
 CHALLENGE|       /
          |      /   ← TARGET: 65-75% success rate
          |     /     (challenging but achievable)
          |    /
          |   /  FLOW ZONE
          |  /
          | /
          |/        BOREDOM
    LOW   |________________________
          LOW                  HIGH
                  SKILL
```

**Implementation:**
- After each question, the algorithm adjusts to target 65-75% success rate
- If 3 questions in a row are correct: next question is harder
- If 2 questions in a row are wrong: next question is easier
- Format variety prevents pattern recognition even at the same difficulty
- Session pacing alternates harder and easier questions (not strictly ascending)

**"Goldilocks Zone" Indicators:**
- If user's session accuracy is in 65-75%: system is well-calibrated (no adjustment)
- If accuracy is 85%+: system is too easy -> increase difficulty
- If accuracy is below 50%: system is too hard -> decrease difficulty, offer encouragement

## Appendix A: Data Model Summary

Key entities the frontend needs to track (for state management):

```
User {
  id, name, level, total_xp, current_streak, best_streak,
  streak_freezes_available, last_practice_date,
  confidence_calibration_score, overall_accuracy,
  created_at, settings
}

TopicProgress {
  user_id, topic_id, sub_topic_id,
  mastery_percentage, accuracy, questions_attempted,
  difficulty_level, status (locked/available/in_progress/competent/mastered),
  ease_factor, interval, next_review_date, last_practiced
}

SessionHistory {
  id, user_id, session_type, started_at, completed_at,
  questions_count, correct_count, xp_earned,
  topics_covered[], accuracy, grade (for sims)
}
