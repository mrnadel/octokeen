# PART A: PRODUCT STRATEGIST OUTPUTS

---

## 1. Product Vision

**MechPrep is the first interview training platform built specifically for mechanical engineers, combining adaptive concept drilling with realistic interview simulation to transform how engineers prepare for technical interviews.** Unlike generic flashcard apps that reward memorization, MechPrep trains the engineering thinking process itself — teaching users to reason through problems the way top candidates do in real interviews, from first principles to practical application. Our goal: every user walks into their interview knowing not just the right answers, but how to think through questions they've never seen before.

## 2. User Personas

### Persona 1: Priya Sharma — Junior Engineer, First Job Hunt

- **Background:** 23, recent BSME graduate from a state university. Strong GPA (3.6), one internship at a mid-size manufacturing company. Applying for entry-level design and manufacturing engineer roles.
- **Pain Points:**
  - Has textbook knowledge but can't connect it to real-world interview questions. Knows beam bending theory but freezes when asked "How would you decide between a bolted and welded joint for this bracket?"
  - Doesn't know what interviewers actually ask — her professors never covered interview prep
  - Gets anxious under time pressure and forgets fundamentals she definitely knows
  - Can't afford paid coaching; YouTube videos feel scattered and low quality
  - Doesn't know if she's "ready" — no signal on whether she'd pass or fail
- **Goals:** Pass technical phone screens for entry-level ME roles. Build confidence. Identify and fill gaps in her fundamentals before interviews.
- **How She'd Use the App:**
  - 20-30 minute daily sessions on the train to work (she's temping while job hunting)
  - Topic-focused drills on areas that come up in her specific target roles (thermodynamics for HVAC companies, materials for aerospace)
  - Run a full mock interview simulation the night before each real interview
  - Review "What the Interviewer Wanted" breakdowns after practice to understand the meta-game
- **What Brings Her Back:**
  - Seeing her Interview Readiness Score climb from 42 to 78 over three weeks
  - The "Aha!" moments when a coaching explanation connects a textbook concept to a real application
  - Streak tracking and the feeling of genuine progress, not just grinding

### Persona 2: Marcus Chen — Mid-Career Engineer, Switching Companies

- **Background:** 31, 7 years of experience. Currently a senior mechanical design engineer at an automotive supplier. Interviewing for roles at Tesla, Apple SPG, and two robotics startups. PE license. Strong on design and GD&T, weaker on controls and fluid dynamics (hasn't touched those since school).
- **Pain Points:**
  - Knows his stuff deeply in his niche but rusty on breadth topics that interviewers still ask about
  - Hasn't interviewed in 5 years; doesn't know what the bar looks like at elite companies now
  - Finds most prep material insultingly basic ("What is stress?") or frustratingly academic
  - Limited time — works 50+ hour weeks, has a family, can only prep in short bursts
  - Worried about system design / open-ended questions where there's no single right answer
- **Goals:** Refresh rusty topics quickly without wasting time on things he already knows. Practice open-ended "design this" questions. Calibrate himself against the bar at top-tier companies.
- **How He'd Use the App:**
  - Adaptive assessment to instantly identify weak spots, skip what he knows
  - Deep-dive sessions on 2-3 weak areas (fluid dynamics, heat transfer, controls basics)
  - System design practice mode for open-ended questions
  - 15-minute "speed round" drills during lunch breaks
- **What Brings Him Back:**
  - The adaptive engine respects his time — no more slogging through basics
  - System design questions with multiple valid approaches and rich feedback
  - Company-specific question patterns (e.g., "Tesla tends to ask about manufacturing process selection and DFM")
  - Comparison to other candidates at his experience level

### Persona 3: Aisha Okafor — Engineer Returning After a Break

- **Background:** 35, MSc in Mechanical Engineering. Spent 6 years as a thermal systems engineer at a defense contractor, then took 3 years off (parental leave, relocation, career reflection). Now re-entering the workforce, targeting mid-level thermal/HVAC roles.
- **Pain Points:**
  - Genuinely forgot things she once knew cold. Embarrassed about it. Feels like she's "starting over"
  - Intimidated by how much the field may have changed (additive manufacturing, simulation tools, etc.)
  - Confidence is low — imposter syndrome amplified by the career gap
  - Doesn't want to be quizzed like a student; wants to rebuild as a professional
  - Most interview prep assumes you just took a class on this material
- **Goals:** Systematically rebuild her technical foundation. Regain confidence that she belongs. Walk into interviews feeling prepared, not panicked.
- **How She'd Use the App:**
  - Start with the diagnostic assessment to see honestly where she stands
  - Follow a structured 4-week "Rebuild Plan" tailored to thermal engineering roles
  - Use the "Explain Like I'm Reviewing" mode — gentler pacing, more context in explanations, links back to fundamentals before jumping to application
  - Practice telling her engineering story confidently (behavioral + technical)
- **What Brings Her Back:**
  - The app never makes her feel dumb. Tone is "you knew this once, let's bring it back"
  - Clear daily plan removes decision fatigue ("Today: 15 min on heat exchangers, 10 min on thermal resistance networks")
  - Visible progress on her Readiness Score rebuilds confidence
  - The "Returning Engineer" track acknowledges her situation and adjusts accordingly

## 3. Key User Journeys

### Journey 1: First-Time User Experience

```
Step 1: Landing & Context Setting (2 minutes)
  - "What are you preparing for?" → [First job / Company switch / Returning to field / General brush-up]
  - "What's your target role?" → [Design / Manufacturing / Thermal / Controls / General ME]
  - "When is your next interview?" → [This week / 2-4 weeks / 1-3 months / No date yet]
  → This sets urgency level, content focus, and pacing

Step 2: Diagnostic Assessment (15-20 minutes)
  - 20 adaptive questions across core ME domains
  - Mix of difficulty levels; branching logic (get one right → harder next; get it wrong → probe depth of gap)
  - Domains covered: Statics & Dynamics, Materials Science, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Machine Design, Manufacturing Processes, GD&T, Controls Basics
  - NO trick questions. Friendly tone. "This isn't a test — it's a map."

Step 3: Results & Personal Plan (3 minutes)
  - Visual radar chart: strength/weakness by domain
  - "Your Starting Readiness Score: 54/100"
  - 3 clear priorities identified: "Focus here first: [Materials], [Thermo], [GD&T]"
  - Personalized daily plan generated based on interview timeline
  - "Your first session is ready. Want to start now? (8 minutes)"

Step 4: First Practice Session (8-10 minutes)
  - 5 questions from their weakest area
  - Full coaching feedback after each question (not just right/wrong)
  - Ends with encouragement + micro-win: "You just nailed 3/5 on your weakest topic. That's a strong start."
  - Prompt to set a daily reminder

Step 5: Hook for Return
  - "Tomorrow's session: [Topic]. 12 minutes. You'll be 6% closer to ready."
  - Push notification next day at their chosen time
```

### Journey 2: Daily Returning User

```
Step 1: Dashboard Landing (10 seconds)
  - Readiness Score prominently displayed with trend arrow
  - "Day 11 of your prep. Today's focus: Heat Transfer"
  - Current streak displayed
  - Quick stats: "Last session: 78% accuracy on Machine Design. Your fluid dynamics gap is closing."

Step 2: Daily Session (12-20 minutes, user chooses intensity)
  - Quick Mode (12 min): 8 questions, focused on today's topic
  - Standard Mode (20 min): 12 questions, today's topic + interleaved review of past weak spots
  - Each question has a 90-second thinking timer (soft — no penalty, but trains time discipline)

Step 3: Per-Question Feedback Loop
  - Answer submitted → Immediate verdict (correct/partial/incorrect)
  - "What the interviewer wanted" mini-card (15-second read)
  - "Strengthen this" button → deep explanation with diagram/example
  - Spaced repetition flag: missed questions re-enter the queue for future sessions

Step 4: Session Summary (1 minute)
  - Score for this session
  - Readiness Score update (animated if it moved)
  - "Concepts to review" list (linkable)
  - "Tomorrow: [Preview topic]. Keep the streak alive."

Step 5: Optional Deep Dive
  - "Want to go deeper on any of today's questions?" → Expanded explanations, related interview questions, engineering context
```

### Journey 3: Pre-Interview Cramming Session

```
Step 1: Trigger
  - User taps "I have an interview coming up" or interview date is approaching
  - "When is it?" → [Tomorrow / In 2-3 days / This week]
  - "What company/role?" → (optional, for tailoring)

Step 2: Rapid Assessment (10 minutes)
  - 15-question speed diagnostic covering high-frequency interview topics
  - Identifies the 3-5 concepts most likely to come up AND most likely to trip this user up
  - "Based on your prep history and common interview patterns, focus on these:"

Step 3: Targeted Cram Drill (30-45 minutes)
  - Curated set of 20 high-yield questions
  - Emphasis on: most commonly asked topics, user's specific weak spots, questions that test reasoning (not just recall)
  - After each: concise "If you see this in the interview, here's the move" coaching note
  - Higher time pressure (60-second soft timers) to simulate interview pace

Step 4: Mock Interview Simulation (25 minutes)
  - 8 questions, interview pacing, no feedback until the end
  - Mixed format: 4 conceptual, 2 problem-solving, 2 open-ended/design
  - Timer visible. Difficulty ramps.
  - Feels like sitting in the interview

Step 5: Final Readiness Report
  - "You're at 73/100. Here's what to keep in mind:"
  - Top 3 strengths to lead with in the interview
  - Top 3 risk areas with 1-sentence reminders ("Remember: for heat exchanger questions, always start with LMTD approach, then discuss effectiveness-NTU as an alternative")
  - Confidence boosters: "You've answered 340 questions over 18 sessions. You've put in the work."
  - Mental prep tips: breathing, pacing, how to handle "I don't know"
```

### Journey 4: Weak Area Recovery Session

```
Step 1: Trigger
  - User sees their radar chart and taps a weak domain (e.g., "Fluid Mechanics: 35%")
  - Or: app recommends it — "Your fluid mechanics score has been flat for a week. Let's fix that."

Step 2: Diagnostic Drill-Down (5 minutes)
  - 8 targeted questions to pinpoint the SUB-TOPIC that's the real problem
  - E.g., "You're fine on Bernoulli and pipe flow. The gap is in compressible flow and boundary layers."
  - Shows the specific concept map with green/yellow/red nodes

Step 3: Concept Rebuild (10 minutes)
  - Teaches before quizzing. NOT just throwing harder questions.
  - "Here's the core concept of boundary layers in 3 key points..."
  - Interactive example: "For this airfoil scenario, what would you expect the boundary layer transition point to be?"
  - Build understanding before testing it

Step 4: Guided Practice (15 minutes)
  - 10 questions on the specific weak sub-topic
  - Scaffolded difficulty: starts easier, ramps up
  - Rich hints available (no penalty for using them — this is learning mode)
  - Each question links back to the concept taught in Step 3

Step 5: Verification & Confidence Check
  - 5 final questions at interview difficulty, no hints
  - "You went from 2/8 to 4/5 on compressible flow in one session."
  - Updated radar chart with visible improvement
  - Schedule follow-up review in 2 days (spaced repetition)
```

## 4. Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)

### Must Have (MVP — ship or fail)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Core question bank (500+ questions across 8 ME domains)** | Without high-quality, interview-relevant questions, there's no product |
| **Question quality: real interview style, not textbook regurgitation** | The entire value prop depends on this. Every question must feel like something an interviewer would actually ask |
| **Per-question coaching feedback** ("What the Interviewer Wanted") | This is the #1 differentiator. Without it, we're just another quiz app |
| **Diagnostic assessment** | Users need to know where they stand from minute one. Without this, they have no personalized starting point |
| **Readiness Score** | Users need a single, visible signal of progress. This is the core motivator |
| **Domain-based topic organization** | Users must be able to drill specific areas (thermo, materials, machine design, etc.) |
| **Difficulty levels per question** | Critical for adaptive experience and appropriate challenge |
| **Basic progress tracking** | Session history, accuracy trends, streak counter |
| **Mobile-responsive web app** | Engineers prep on their phones during commutes and lunch breaks |

### Should Have (high impact, build immediately after MVP)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Adaptive question selection** (spaced repetition + weak-area weighting) | Dramatically improves learning efficiency. The difference between "a quiz" and "a smart tutor" |
| **Interview Simulation Mode** | Full timed mock interview. Key differentiator and highest-value feature for users close to interview date |
| **Personalized study plan** | Daily plan based on target date and weak areas. Removes decision fatigue |
| **Concept explanations with diagrams** | Some concepts need visual explanation (Mohr's circle, P-V diagrams, mechanism analysis) |
| **Sub-topic granularity** | Not just "Thermodynamics" but "2nd Law," "Heat Exchangers," "Refrigeration Cycles," etc. |
| **Bookmarking / review queue** | Users need to flag and revisit tricky questions |
| **Pre-interview cram mode** | High-value feature for users with imminent interviews |

### Could Have (nice-to-have, build when core is solid)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Company-specific question patterns** | "Tesla asks about DFM. SpaceX emphasizes failure analysis." High value but requires extensive research |
| **System design / open-ended question module** | Complex to build but addresses a real gap for senior candidates |
| **Peer comparison** ("You're in the top 30% for your experience level") | Motivating but requires significant user base |
| **Behavioral question prep module** | Adjacent need; most ME interview prep neglects this |
| **Calculation workspace** (scratchpad with units) | Useful for quantitative problems but adds technical complexity |
| **Dark mode** | Often requested, improves late-night study sessions |
| **Offline mode** | Useful for commuters but adds significant technical overhead |
| **Community features** (discussion on questions) | Builds engagement but introduces moderation burden |

### Won't Have (not now, maybe never)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **AI-generated questions** (for now) | Quality control is paramount. Every question must be expert-vetted. AI generation introduces risk of incorrect or poorly framed questions |
| **Live tutoring / coaching** | Fundamentally different business model. Doesn't scale for MVP |
| **Video content / lectures** | We're building a practice tool, not a course. YouTube and university lectures already exist |
| **Resume review / job matching** | Scope creep. Stay focused on interview prep |
| **FE/PE exam prep** | Different audience, different question style, different product. Could be a future spinoff |
| **Gamification with leaderboards / badges** | Risks trivializing serious career preparation. Progress signals should feel professional, not juvenile |
| **Multi-language support** (initially) | English-first, revisit later based on demand |

## 5. Product Principles

### Principle 1: Train Thinking, Not Recall
> Every question should require reasoning, not memory retrieval. If a user can answer by reciting a definition, the question has failed. Real interviewers test whether you can *think* through a problem, not whether you memorized a formula.

### Principle 2: Respect the User's Time
> An engineer with 15 free minutes should get meaningful prep done in 15 minutes. No filler. No unnecessary animations. No mandatory tutorials. Adaptive difficulty ensures nobody wastes time on things they already know. Every session should feel like the highest-value 15 minutes they could spend.

### Principle 3: Make the Invisible Visible
> The biggest gap in interview prep is not knowing what interviewers are *actually* evaluating. Every question includes "What the Interviewer Wanted" — the hidden evaluation criteria, the reasoning pattern they're testing, and what separates a good answer from a great one. Demystify the interview.

### Principle 4: Build Confidence Through Evidence
> Confidence shouldn't come from vague reassurance ("You've got this!"). It should come from data: "You've correctly analyzed 47 thermodynamics problems at interview difficulty. Your accuracy on heat transfer has improved from 30% to 82% in two weeks." Real evidence of real progress.

### Principle 5: Difficulty is the Product
> Easy questions feel good but teach nothing. The app should keep users at the edge of their ability — where learning actually happens. Comfort is not the goal. Growth is the goal. But struggle should always feel productive, never punishing.

### Principle 6: Context Over Isolation
> Never present a concept in isolation. Every question should connect to real engineering scenarios: "This is why thermal expansion matters when designing interference fits." "This is the failure mode that killed the Challenger O-rings." Engineering knowledge lives in context.

### Principle 7: Fail Privately, Succeed Publicly
> The app is a safe space to get things wrong. No social pressure. No public scores. No judgment. Getting a question wrong is the *most valuable* thing that can happen — it's where learning occurs. The tone after a wrong answer should be "Here's what to see next time," never "Wrong!"

## 6. What Makes This Different — 5 Concrete Differentiators

### Differentiator 1: "What the Interviewer Wanted" Coaching Layer
Generic quiz apps tell you right/wrong. We tell you *why this question exists*: what concept the interviewer is probing, what reasoning pattern they want to see, what a strong answer demonstrates versus a weak one, and how to structure your response. This is the difference between studying answers and learning to interview.

**Example:** For "What's the difference between fatigue failure and static failure?" a generic app says "Fatigue occurs under cyclic loading." We say: "The interviewer is testing whether you think about failure modes systematically. A strong answer starts with the loading conditions, discusses the fracture mechanism (crack initiation vs. yielding), mentions the S-N curve and endurance limit, and — critically — gives a real-world example of each. The interviewer wants to see that you don't just know definitions but can apply them to design decisions. A top answer would also mention how you'd design differently to prevent each failure type."

### Differentiator 2: Adaptive Difficulty That Respects Experience
The app doesn't make a 7-year veteran answer "What is Young's modulus?" It rapidly identifies what you already know and skips it. The diagnostic creates a precise map of your knowledge, and every subsequent session targets the gaps. For returning engineers, it gently rebuilds foundations without being condescending. For senior engineers, it jumps to nuanced application questions immediately. You always feel appropriately challenged.

### Differentiator 3: Interview Simulation Mode with Realistic Pressure
Not just questions — a full interview experience. Timed. No feedback until the end. Difficulty ramps. Mix of question types mirrors real interview structure. Followed by a detailed debrief that tells you not just how you scored, but how you *performed*: "You spent too long on question 3 — in a real interview, you'd want to give a structured 2-minute answer and move on." This trains the meta-skill of interviewing, not just the technical content.

### Differentiator 4: Mechanical-Engineering-Specific Throughout
Every question, every explanation, every example is written by and for mechanical engineers. No generic "engineering fundamentals" padding. Questions reference real components (bearings, heat exchangers, injection molds), real failure modes (fatigue, creep, buckling), real manufacturing decisions (casting vs. machining trade-offs), and real industry contexts (automotive, aerospace, consumer products, energy). The vocabulary, depth, and framing match what a real ME interviewer would use.

### Differentiator 5: Readiness Score with Actionable Intelligence
Not just a number — a multi-dimensional assessment that tells you exactly where you stand and what to do about it. Your overall score is broken into conceptual depth, practical reasoning, breadth coverage, and communication clarity. Each dimension has specific, actionable feedback: "Your thermodynamics conceptual knowledge is strong (88%), but your ability to apply it to open-ended design scenarios is weak (41%). Practice: here are 5 design-scenario thermo questions to close this gap." The score is calibrated against real interview expectations, not arbitrary thresholds.

## 7. How Real Mechanical Engineering Interviews Work

### Structure of a Typical ME Technical Interview

**Phone Screen (30-45 minutes)**
- 5-10 minutes: introductions, role overview, resume walkthrough
- 20-30 minutes: technical questions (typically 4-8 questions)
- 5 minutes: candidate questions
- Questions tend to be conceptual and verbal — no calculation expected
- Rapid-fire at some companies; more conversational at others

**On-Site Technical Round (45-60 minutes, sometimes multiple rounds)**
- Deeper technical questions with follow-ups
- May include whiteboard problems (sketch a mechanism, draw a free body diagram, work through a calculation)
- Often includes open-ended design questions ("How would you design X?")
- Some companies include a practical component (read a drawing, review a design, analyze a failure)

**Hiring Manager Round (30-45 minutes)**
- Mix of behavioral and technical
- "Tell me about a project where..." format
- Tests communication ability and engineering judgment, not just knowledge

### Types of Questions Interviewers Ask

1. **Conceptual fundamentals:** "Explain the difference between..." / "What is...and why does it matter?"
   - Testing: Do you actually understand the concept, or did you just memorize it?

2. **Application / scenario questions:** "If you had a shaft experiencing vibration, what would you check?"
   - Testing: Can you connect theory to real engineering problems?

3. **Design / open-ended:** "How would you design a mechanism to convert rotary to linear motion for this application?"
   - Testing: Engineering judgment, creativity, systematic thinking, trade-off analysis

4. **Failure analysis / troubleshooting:** "This weld keeps cracking. What could be causing it?"
   - Testing: Diagnostic reasoning, knowledge of failure modes, root cause thinking

5. **Quantitative / estimation:** "Estimate the force required to..." / "Walk me through the calculation for..."
   - Testing: Can you set up problems correctly? Do you have engineering intuition for magnitudes?

6. **Materials & manufacturing selection:** "What material would you choose for...?" / "How would you manufacture this part?"
   - Testing: Practical engineering knowledge, understanding of trade-offs (cost, performance, manufacturability)

7. **Drawing / GD&T interpretation:** "What does this tolerance callout mean?" / "Identify the issue with this drawing"
   - Testing: Can you read and create engineering documentation?

8. **Behavioral-technical hybrid:** "Tell me about a time you had to make a design trade-off under constraints"
   - Testing: Real-world engineering experience, communication, judgment

### What Interviewers Actually Evaluate

| Evaluation Criteria | What They're Looking For | How They Test It |
|---|---|---|
| **Conceptual understanding** | Can you explain WHY, not just WHAT? | Follow-up questions: "Why does that happen?" |
| **Structured thinking** | Do you approach problems systematically? | Open-ended questions where the approach matters more than the answer |
| **Engineering judgment** | Can you make reasonable decisions with incomplete information? | Design questions with trade-offs and no single right answer |
| **Practical awareness** | Do you understand how things are actually made and used? | Manufacturing, materials, and real-world application questions |
| **Communication clarity** | Can you explain technical concepts clearly? | They literally listen to HOW you explain, not just what you say |
| **Intellectual honesty** | Do you know what you don't know? | Trick questions, edge cases, "Are you sure about that?" |
| **Curiosity & engagement** | Do you seem genuinely interested in engineering? | Follow-up discussions, questions you ask back, enthusiasm in answers |

### Common Interview Traps and Patterns

1. **The Silence Trap:** Interviewer asks a question and says nothing. Candidate gives a one-sentence answer and stops. The interviewer was waiting for depth. **Counter:** Always elaborate. Give the concept, the application, and an example.

2. **The "Are You Sure?" Trap:** You give a correct answer. Interviewer says, "Are you sure about that?" Candidate panics and changes their answer. **Counter:** If you're confident, stand by your answer with reasoning. "Yes, because [reason]."

3. **The Scope Creep Question:** "How would you design a heat exchanger?" is impossibly broad. Candidates who try to answer everything flounder. **Counter:** Ask clarifying questions. "What's the application? What are the constraints? What fluids are involved?"

4. **The "Walk Me Through" Trap:** Interviewer asks you to walk through a process. Candidate gives a high-level overview. Interviewer wanted step-by-step detail. **Counter:** Start with the overview, then ask "Would you like me to go deeper on any part of this?"

5. **The Cross-Domain Bridge:** "How does thermal expansion affect your tolerance stackup?" Tests whether you can connect concepts across domains. Candidates who only think within silos fail this. **Counter:** Always consider adjacent physical phenomena.

6. **The Practical Reality Check:** "That's the textbook answer. How would you actually do this in practice?" Tests whether you've worked in real engineering or just studied it. **Counter:** Reference manufacturing constraints, cost, time, tooling, and real-world imperfections.

7. **The Estimation Sanity Check:** "You calculated 50,000 N. Does that seem reasonable for this application?" Tests engineering intuition. **Counter:** Always gut-check your numbers against physical intuition.

### What Separates Strong from Weak Candidates

| Dimension | Weak Candidate | Strong Candidate |
|---|---|---|
| **Answer structure** | Rambles, jumps between ideas | States conclusion first, then supports with reasoning, then gives an example |
| **Depth vs. breadth** | Gives a surface-level answer and stops | Goes deep on the most important aspect, acknowledges other factors |
| **Uncertainty handling** | Makes up an answer or freezes | Says "I'm not certain about the exact value, but here's how I'd reason through it..." |
| **Real-world grounding** | Every answer sounds like a textbook | References real applications, manufacturing realities, failure cases |
| **Follow-up readiness** | Can't go deeper when probed | Has layers of understanding; each follow-up reveals more depth |
| **Question asking** | Answers every question as stated | Asks clarifying questions when the problem is under-defined |
| **Connection-making** | Treats each question as isolated | Connects concepts across domains ("This relates to what we discussed earlier about...") |

## 8. Interview Simulation Mode Design

### Session Structure

**Standard Mock Interview (25 minutes, 8 questions)**

```
Question 1-2: Warm-Up (Conceptual Fundamentals)
  - Difficulty: Medium
  - Time: 2 minutes each
  - Purpose: Settle nerves, establish baseline
  - Examples: "Explain the difference between engineering stress and true stress"
             "What are the primary heat transfer mechanisms?"

Question 3-4: Core Technical (Application & Analysis)
  - Difficulty: Medium-Hard
  - Time: 3 minutes each
  - Purpose: Test applied knowledge
  - Examples: "A steel shaft is experiencing unexpected fatigue failure at 60% of its calculated endurance limit. What factors might explain this?"
             "Walk me through how you'd size a bearing for a rotating shaft with these loads..."

Question 5-6: Deep Dive (Problem-Solving & Calculation)
  - Difficulty: Hard
  - Time: 4 minutes each
  - Purpose: Test depth and quantitative reasoning
  - Examples: "Estimate the heat loss through a 3m x 4m single-pane glass window on a winter day. State your assumptions."
             "This gear train needs to achieve a 50:1 reduction in a compact package. Walk me through your design approach."

Question 7: Design / Open-Ended
  - Difficulty: Hard
  - Time: 5 minutes
  - Purpose: Test engineering judgment and structured thinking
  - Examples: "Design a mechanism to automatically sort parts by weight on a production line"
             "How would you approach redesigning this bracket to reduce weight by 30%?"

Question 8: Curveball / Cross-Domain
  - Difficulty: Varies
  - Time: 3 minutes
  - Purpose: Test adaptability and breadth
  - Examples: "How would you explain the concept of entropy to a non-engineer?"
             "What's the most interesting engineering failure you've studied, and what did you learn from it?"
```

**Quick Mock Interview (12 minutes, 5 questions)**
- Compressed version: 1 warm-up, 2 core technical, 1 design, 1 curveball
- For users with limited time or who want a rapid confidence check

### Pressure Mechanics

| Mechanic | Implementation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Visible countdown timer** | Per-question timer displayed prominently. Turns yellow at 75% time used, red at 90% | Trains time management. In real interviews, spending 10 minutes on one question is a disaster |
| **No feedback during simulation** | No right/wrong indication until session ends | Simulates real interview — you don't know how you're doing. Trains composure under uncertainty |
| **Difficulty ramp** | Questions get progressively harder | Mirrors real interview pattern where interviewers probe until you reach your limit |
| **No "skip" option** | Must submit an answer or explicitly select "I don't know" | In real interviews, you can't skip. Trains graceful handling of unknown questions |
| **Follow-up probability** | After certain answers, a follow-up question appears: "Can you go deeper on that?" or "What if the constraint changed to...?" | Simulates the most stressful part of real interviews: being probed on your answer |
| **Interruption simulation** | Occasionally, mid-answer: "Let me redirect you — what about [related topic]?" | Trains recovery from disruption, which happens in real interviews |

### Feedback Model

**Per-Question Feedback (shown after simulation ends):**
```
Question: "How would you decide between a bolted and welded joint for a structural bracket?"

Your Answer: [displayed]

Verdict: ★★★☆☆ Partial — Correct Direction, Missing Key Elements

What Was Being Tested:
  → Design decision-making process
  → Knowledge of joint types and their trade-offs
  → Practical manufacturing awareness

What a Strong Answer Includes:
  ✓ Loading conditions (static vs. dynamic vs. fatigue)
  ✓ Service environment (temperature, corrosion, vibration)
  ✓ Assembly/disassembly requirements
  ✓ Manufacturing constraints and cost
  ✓ Inspection and maintenance access
  ✓ Specific recommendation with justification

What You Covered: Loading conditions, basic cost comparison
What You Missed: Service environment, assembly requirements, inspection access
Your Key Improvement: Always consider the full lifecycle — not just the loading, but maintenance, inspection, and eventual disassembly/replacement

Time Used: 2:34 / 3:00 — Good pacing
```

**Session Summary Feedback:**
```
Interview Simulation Complete

Overall Performance: 68/100

Performance by Dimension:
  Conceptual Accuracy:     ████████░░  78%
  Reasoning Quality:       ██████░░░░  62%
  Practical Awareness:     █████░░░░░  52%
  Communication Clarity:   ████████░░  76%
  Time Management:         ███████░░░  72%

Strongest Moment: Question 2 — Your explanation of stress concentration factors was clear, structured, and included a great real-world example.

Weakest Moment: Question 5 — You jumped to a calculation without stating your assumptions. In a real interview, the interviewer wants to see your assumptions first.

Key Patterns:
  ⚠ You tend to give short answers on open-ended questions. Expand more.
  ⚠ You didn't ask any clarifying questions. This is a red flag for interviewers.
  ✓ Your pacing was good — you used time well without rushing.
  ✓ You handled the curveball question with composure.

If This Were a Real Interview:
  "You'd likely pass a phone screen but would struggle in an on-site technical deep dive. Your fundamentals are solid, but your answers lack the practical depth that distinguishes a strong candidate. Focus on connecting every answer to real-world engineering context."

Action Items:
  1. Practice open-ended design questions (your weakest area)
  2. Drill the habit of asking clarifying questions before answering
  3. Review: failure analysis, manufacturing process selection
```

### Interview Readiness Score Calculation Logic

```
INTERVIEW READINESS SCORE (0-100)

Composed of 5 weighted dimensions:

1. Conceptual Depth (25%)
   - Measures: accuracy on fundamental and applied concept questions
   - Inputs: accuracy rate on conceptual questions, weighted by difficulty
   - Scoring: <50% accuracy at medium difficulty = 0-30
              50-70% accuracy at medium difficulty = 30-50
              >70% accuracy at medium difficulty = 50-70
              >70% accuracy at hard difficulty = 70-90
              >85% accuracy at hard difficulty with follow-up depth = 90-100

2. Practical Reasoning (25%)
   - Measures: performance on application, troubleshooting, and design questions
   - Inputs: accuracy on scenario-based questions, quality of reasoning (partial credit for good approach with wrong answer)
   - Bonus: mentioning manufacturing constraints, cost, real-world factors

3. Breadth Coverage (20%)
   - Measures: how many of the 8 core domains have been practiced and show competency
   - Inputs: number of domains with >60% accuracy at medium+ difficulty
   - Scoring: 3/8 domains = ~40, 5/8 = ~60, 7/8 = ~80, 8/8 with depth = ~95
   - Penalizes: any domain below 40% accuracy (a "hole" interviewers will find)

4. Communication Clarity (15%)
   - Measures: in simulation mode, whether answers are structured and complete
   - Inputs: answer completeness score, structured reasoning detected
   - Proxy signals: time used (too fast = insufficient depth, too slow = rambling),
     coverage of key points in open-ended answers

5. Consistency & Trend (15%)
   - Measures: performance stability over time
   - Inputs: standard deviation of recent session scores (lower = more consistent = better),
     trend direction over last 10 sessions
   - Penalizes: high variance (unpredictable performance = risky candidate)
   - Rewards: steady upward trend

CALIBRATION:
  Score 0-30:   "Significant gaps. Start with fundamentals."
  Score 31-50:  "Building foundation. Focus on weak areas."
  Score 51-65:  "Getting there. Ready for phone screens with some risk."
  Score 66-80:  "Solid preparation. Competitive for most roles."
  Score 81-90:  "Strong candidate. Ready for on-site interviews."
  Score 91-100: "Exceptional. You'd impress at top-tier companies."

UPDATE FREQUENCY:
  - Recalculated after every session
  - Weighted toward recent performance (exponential decay, half-life = 7 days)
  - Simulation mode results count 2x (higher-fidelity signal)

## 10. Answer Coaching Framework

### What Makes a Strong Answer vs. a Weak Answer

| Element | Weak Answer | Strong Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | Stream of consciousness. Jumps between points. Hard to follow. | Clear structure: State the answer → Support with reasoning → Ground with example |
| **Specificity** | "It depends on the application" (and stops there) | "It depends on three key factors: [1], [2], [3]. For example, in [application], I'd choose [X] because [reason]" |
| **Depth** | States the what. "Fatigue is failure under cyclic loading." | Explains the why and how. "Fatigue occurs because cyclic loading causes microscopic crack initiation at stress concentrations, which propagate with each cycle until the remaining cross-section can't support the load — leading to sudden fracture often well below the yield strength." |
| **Practical grounding** | Every answer sounds like a textbook | References real components, real failures, real manufacturing constraints. "I saw this in a project where..." |
| **Uncertainty handling** | Makes something up or says "I don't know" and stops | "I'm not certain of the exact coefficient, but I know it's on the order of [X], and here's how I'd verify it..." |
| **Scope management** | Tries to cover everything, covers nothing well | Addresses the core of the question deeply, then acknowledges related factors briefly: "I focused on the structural aspects, but thermal and manufacturing considerations would also factor in." |
| **Trade-off awareness** | Gives one answer as if it's the only option | Presents multiple options with pros/cons: "You could use approach A which gives [benefit] but [drawback], or approach B which..." |

### The SPEC Framework for Structuring Technical Answers

**S — State your answer directly**
Lead with your conclusion or the key point. Don't make the interviewer wait through a preamble.
> "The primary difference is that fatigue failure occurs under cyclic loading well below the yield strength, while static failure occurs when the applied stress exceeds the material's yield or ultimate strength in a single loading event."

**P — Provide the reasoning**
Explain why. Show your thought process. This is where you demonstrate understanding.
> "This happens because cyclic loading causes microscopic crack initiation — typically at stress concentrations like notches, keyways, or surface defects. These cracks propagate incrementally with each load cycle. The S-N curve captures this relationship, and the endurance limit represents the stress below which fatigue life is theoretically infinite for ferrous metals."

**E — Example or application**
Ground it in reality. Give a specific, concrete example.
> "For example, the de Havilland Comet aircraft disasters in the 1950s were caused by fatigue crack growth from the square window corners — a geometric stress concentration subjected to pressurization cycles. This fundamentally changed how we design for fatigue in aerospace."

**C — Connect or caveat**
Tie it to the broader context or acknowledge what you've left out.
> "In practice, designing against fatigue requires considering the surface finish, environmental factors like corrosion, mean stress effects using Goodman or Soderberg criteria, and the statistical nature of fatigue data. The approach differs significantly between infinite-life and damage-tolerance design philosophies."

### How to Show Engineering Thinking

1. **Ask clarifying questions before answering open-ended questions.** This is one of the strongest signals an interviewer looks for. "Before I answer, can I clarify — is this a static or dynamic loading scenario?" shows you understand that the answer depends on the context.

2. **State your assumptions explicitly.** When doing any estimation or analysis: "I'll assume standard atmospheric conditions, steady-state operation, and negligible radiation losses." This shows rigor.

3. **Think about the edges.** After giving your answer, briefly note when it breaks down. "This applies for Reynolds numbers below about 2300. Above that, we'd need to consider turbulent flow, which changes the analysis significantly."

4. **Consider multiple failure modes.** When analyzing a design, don't just check one thing. "I'd check yielding, buckling, and fatigue — the critical failure mode depends on the loading and geometry."

5. **Show order-of-magnitude intuition.** "Before I calculate, I'd expect this to be on the order of a few kilonewtons based on similar applications I've worked on." Then calculate. If your answer is wildly different, investigate why.

6. **Reference real decisions, not just theory.** "In practice, you'd also need to consider the cost difference — machining this feature adds $3-5 per part at volume, so we'd evaluate whether it's structurally necessary."

### Common Mistakes Candidates Make

1. **The Definition Trap:** Answering "What is X?" with a textbook definition and stopping. Interviewers want to hear that you *understand* X, not that you *memorized* X. Always go beyond the definition to application and implications.

2. **The Hedge Without Substance:** "It depends on the application" without then exploring what it depends ON. This sounds evasive. Instead: "It depends on three factors: [list them]. Let me walk through the most common scenario."

3. **Calculation Without Sanity Check:** Solving a problem and announcing "47,000 N" without pausing to assess whether that's reasonable. Always gut-check your answer. "47,000 N seems high for this small bracket — let me double-check my assumption about the loading."

4. **Ignoring Manufacturing Reality:** Designing a theoretically perfect part that can't be manufactured economically. When discussing any design, mention how it would actually be made.

5. **The Monologue:** Speaking for 5 minutes straight without pausing. In a real conversation, check in: "Shall I go deeper on any of these points?"

6. **Never Saying "I Don't Know":** Making up an answer is far worse than saying "I'm not sure about the specific value, but here's how I'd approach finding it." Interviewers respect honesty and resourcefulness.

7. **Treating Every Question as Isolated:** Not connecting concepts across questions. If an earlier question about thermal expansion relates to the current question about tolerance, say so. This shows integrated thinking.

8. **Skipping Free Body Diagrams:** When asked about forces or loading, always start by identifying the free body, the boundary conditions, and the loads. Jumping to formulas without this foundation is a red flag.

9. **Overcomplicating the Answer:** Using FEA when a hand calculation would suffice. Using a complex material when a simple one works. Interviewers value engineering elegance — the simplest solution that meets requirements.

10. **Not Asking About Constraints:** Answering a design question without knowing the constraints (budget, timeline, volume, environment, safety factors) shows inexperience. Real engineers always ask about constraints first.

## 11. Readiness Feedback Model

### Scoring Dimensions

**Dimension 1: Conceptual Depth (What do you understand?)**
```
Level 1 (Recall):       Can state definitions and formulas
Level 2 (Comprehension): Can explain WHY — underlying physics and mechanisms
Level 3 (Application):   Can apply concepts to new scenarios correctly
Level 4 (Analysis):      Can decompose complex problems using multiple concepts
Level 5 (Synthesis):     Can combine concepts from different domains to solve novel problems

Assessment: Based on question accuracy at each Bloom's-taxonomy-aligned difficulty level
Feedback example: "You're solid at Level 3 (applying concepts to standard scenarios) but struggle
when problems require combining concepts from different domains. Practice cross-domain questions."
```

**Dimension 2: Practical Reasoning (Can you do real engineering?)**
```
Level 1: Can identify relevant engineering parameters
Level 2: Can select appropriate approaches for standard problems
Level 3: Can make justified trade-off decisions with reasoning
Level 4: Can identify failure modes, manufacturing constraints, and real-world factors unprompted
Level 5: Can approach novel, under-defined problems with a systematic engineering framework

Assessment: Based on performance on scenario, design, and troubleshooting questions
Feedback example: "Your theoretical knowledge is strong, but you rarely mention manufacturing
constraints or cost. Interviewers notice this. Practice thinking about the full product lifecycle."
```

**Dimension 3: Breadth Coverage (Where are your blind spots?)**
```
Domains tracked:
  - Statics & Dynamics
  - Mechanics of Materials (Strength of Materials)
  - Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
  - Fluid Mechanics
  - Machine Design (fasteners, bearings, gears, shafts, etc.)
  - Materials Science & Selection
  - Manufacturing Processes
  - GD&T & Engineering Drawing

Each domain rated: Weak (<50%) / Developing (50-70%) / Competent (70-85%) / Strong (>85%)

Feedback example: "You have strong coverage across 6 of 8 domains, but Fluid Mechanics (38%)
and GD&T (42%) are significant gaps. These come up in most ME interviews. Priority: close these gaps."
```

**Dimension 4: Communication Clarity (Can you explain your thinking?)**
```
Assessed through:
  - Answer completeness in simulation mode (did you cover key points?)
  - Answer structure (did you use a clear framework or ramble?)
  - Time management (too fast = incomplete, too slow = verbose)
  - Appropriate depth (did you go deep where it mattered?)

Feedback example: "Your answers tend to be technically correct but disorganized. Practice the
SPEC framework: State your answer, Provide reasoning, give an Example, Connect/Caveat.
Interviewers evaluate how you communicate, not just what you know."
```

### Actionable Feedback, Not Just Scores

**Principle: Every score must come with a specific action.**

Bad feedback: "Thermodynamics: 62%. Needs improvement."

Good feedback:
```
Thermodynamics: 62% (Developing)

What's working:
  - You nail 1st and 2nd law conceptual questions (89% accuracy)
  - Your understanding of ideal gas processes is solid

What's holding you back:
  - Heat exchanger analysis is your weakest sub-topic (3/11 correct)
  - You consistently forget to consider entropy generation in irreversible processes
  - Open-ended thermo design questions (e.g., "design a cooling system") score 40% —
    you tend to jump to a solution without considering alternatives

Your next 3 steps:
  1. Complete the "Heat Exchanger Deep Dive" recovery session (20 min)
  2. Practice 5 open-ended thermo design questions using the SPEC framework
  3. Review: LMTD method, effectiveness-NTU method, entropy generation in real processes

Estimated time to close this gap: 4-5 focused sessions (about 1 week)

## 12. "What the Interviewer Wanted" Framework

### Metadata Schema for Every Question

Every question in the database should include the following structured metadata:

```yaml
question_id: ME-MECH-042
question_text: "A steel shaft with a keyway is failing by fatigue after 6 months
               of service at loads well below the calculated endurance limit.
               What could be causing this?"

# ─── WHAT THE INTERVIEWER WANTED ───

real_concept_tested:
  primary: "Fatigue failure — stress concentration effects and real-world derating factors"
  secondary:
    - "Understanding of S-N curve limitations"
    - "Awareness of surface finish, residual stress, and environmental effects on fatigue"
    - "Root cause analysis / diagnostic reasoning"

why_interviewers_ask_this:
  "This question separates candidates who understand fatigue from a textbook perspective
   from those who understand it in practice. The textbook endurance limit assumes ideal
   conditions — polished specimen, no stress concentrations, room temperature, no corrosion.
   Real components have none of these advantages. The interviewer wants to see if you
   immediately recognize that the keyway IS the answer (stress concentration) and then
   explore additional factors systematically."

what_strong_candidates_notice:
  - "The keyway is a geometric stress concentration — this should be the first thing mentioned"
  - "The endurance limit from textbook data needs to be modified by factors: surface finish (Ka),
     size factor (Kb), reliability factor (Kc), temperature factor (Kd), and critically,
     the stress concentration factor (Ke/Kf)"
  - "The 'calculated' endurance limit may not have properly accounted for these correction factors"
  - "Additional factors: fretting corrosion at the key-shaft interface, residual stresses
     from manufacturing, environmental factors (corrosion, temperature cycling)"
  - "Strong candidates propose a systematic investigation: fractographic analysis of the
     failure surface, FEA of the keyway region, review of the original fatigue calculation"

what_weak_candidates_say:
  - "'Maybe the material is bad' — vague, doesn't demonstrate fatigue understanding"
  - "'The load might be higher than expected' — possible, but misses the stress concentration
     which is the obvious culprit given the keyway is mentioned"
  - "'Fatigue' without explaining the mechanism or connection to the keyway"
  - "Any answer that doesn't mention stress concentration at the keyway is a red flag"

red_flags_in_answers:
  - "Not mentioning the keyway as a stress concentration (this is the gift in the question)"
  - "Confusing fatigue with static yielding"
  - "Stating the endurance limit is a fixed material property without acknowledging modification factors"
  - "Not considering surface condition, environment, or manufacturing effects"
  - "Jumping to 'replace with a stronger material' without understanding the root cause"

ideal_answer_structure:
  "1. Immediately identify the keyway as a stress concentration factor — this is likely the
      primary cause, as it creates a local stress significantly higher than the nominal stress.
   2. Explain the Marin factors: the textbook endurance limit must be derated for surface
      finish, size, reliability, temperature, and stress concentration. The modified endurance
      limit may be much lower than the calculated value.
   3. Discuss additional contributing factors: fretting corrosion between key and shaft,
      possible residual tensile stresses from machining, environmental corrosion, or
      misalignment causing unexpected bending loads.
   4. Propose investigation: examine the fracture surface (beach marks would confirm fatigue),
      perform FEA on the keyway geometry, review the original calculation assumptions.
   5. Suggest corrective actions: fillet radius at keyway root, surface treatment (shot peening
      to induce compressive residual stress), consider spline connection as alternative."

scoring_rubric:
  5_star: "Identifies keyway stress concentration immediately. Discusses Marin modification
           factors for endurance limit. Mentions additional factors (fretting, surface finish,
           environment). Proposes investigation approach. Suggests corrective actions.
           Shows systematic thinking throughout."
  4_star: "Identifies stress concentration. Discusses endurance limit correction. Mentions
           1-2 additional factors. Good reasoning but may miss investigation or corrective approach."
  3_star: "Identifies stress concentration but doesn't connect it to endurance limit modification.
           OR discusses modification factors without highlighting the keyway specifically.
           Partial understanding shown."
  2_star: "Mentions fatigue correctly but gives a vague or incomplete explanation. Doesn't
           clearly connect the keyway to the failure. Limited depth."
  1_star: "Vague answer ('bad material,' 'overloaded') without demonstrating fatigue understanding.
           Doesn't identify the stress concentration."

how_to_improve:
  if_scored_1_or_2:
    "Review fundamentals: fatigue failure mechanism, S-N curves, endurance limit concept,
     and stress concentration factors. Study the Marin equation for modified endurance limit.
     Key resource: Shigley's Chapter 6 (Fatigue Failure)."
  if_scored_3:
    "You understand the pieces but need to connect them. Practice: when you see a geometry
     feature mentioned in a fatigue question, ALWAYS evaluate it as a stress concentration.
     Drill the Marin modification factors until they're automatic."
  if_scored_4:
    "Strong answer. To reach the top level, practice proposing a complete investigation plan
     and corrective action. Think like an engineer who owns this problem, not just one who
     can identify it."
