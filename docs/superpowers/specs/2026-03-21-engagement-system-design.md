# Engagement System Design

**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Draft
**Goal:** Build a comprehensive engagement loop that drives users to complete more course lessons, return daily, and stay motivated long-term.

## Context

MechReady is a Duolingo-style Mechanical Engineering interview prep app built with Next.js 16, React 19, Zustand, and PostgreSQL. It already has: XP, 30 levels, 24 achievements, streaks, stars (1-3 per lesson), daily challenges, 6 practice modes, and a 10-unit structured course.

**Problem:** Users finish a session and leave. Retention drops after initial excitement. Users avoid harder topics. There's no short-term goal system, no competitive element, no secondary economy, and no "one more lesson" hooks.

**Design philosophy:** Soft scarcity + positive reinforcement. Never block users from learning. Create urgency through time-limited bonuses, rotating goals, and weekly competitive resets.

## System Overview

Seven interconnected subsystems:

1. **Quest System** — daily/weekly rotating missions (the core engagement engine)
2. **Gems Currency** — secondary economy for streak protection and cosmetics
3. **League System** — weekly competitive rankings with promotion/demotion
4. **Session Continuation Hooks** — contextual "one more" nudges after each lesson
5. **Streak Enhancements** — freeze, repair, and milestone rewards
6. **Comeback Mechanics** — re-engagement flow for lapsed users
7. **Dashboard Nudge Cards** — smart contextual motivation on the home screen

---

## 1. Quest System

### Purpose
Give users concrete short-term goals that rotate, creating daily and weekly reasons to return and complete lessons. This is the primary engagement driver.

### Daily Quests
- **Count:** 3 quests per day
- **Reset:** Midnight local time
- **Quest pool** (system picks 3 randomly each day):
  - "Complete 2 lessons" (course lessons count, practice sessions count as 0.5)
  - "Get 80%+ accuracy on any session"
  - "Practice a topic you haven't touched in 7+ days"
  - "Complete today's Daily Challenge"
  - "Answer 15 questions correctly"
  - "Earn 100 XP today"
  - "Get 3 stars on any lesson"
  - "Complete a lesson in [specific unit user is currently on]"
  - "Answer 5 questions in under 30 seconds each"
  - "Complete a practice session with no wrong answers"
- **Rewards per quest:** 25 bonus XP + 5 gems
- **All 3 completed bonus:** Treasure chest containing 50 XP + 15 gems

### Weekly Quests
- **Count:** 3 quests per week
- **Reset:** Monday 00:00 local time
- **Quest pool** (system picks 3 randomly each week):
  - "Complete 5 course lessons"
  - "Earn 500 XP this week"
  - "Get 3 stars on 3 different lessons"
  - "Practice 4 different topics"
  - "Complete all 7 daily challenges this week"
  - "Maintain a 7-day streak"
  - "Complete 3 lessons in [current unit]"
  - "Answer 50 questions correctly"
  - "Finish a unit"
  - "Score 90%+ on 3 sessions"
- **Rewards per quest:** 75 XP + 20 gems
- **All 3 completed bonus:** 150 XP + 50 gems

### Data Model

```typescript
interface Quest {
  id: string
  type: 'daily' | 'weekly'
  title: string
  description: string
  icon: string // emoji
  target: number // e.g., 2 for "complete 2 lessons"
  progress: number // current progress
  reward: { xp: number; gems: number }
  trackingKey: QuestTrackingKey // what event increments progress
  filter?: Record<string, string> // optional filters (e.g., topicId, unitId)
}

type QuestTrackingKey =
  | 'lessons_completed'
  | 'sessions_completed'
  | 'questions_correct'
  | 'accuracy_above_threshold'
  | 'topics_practiced'
  | 'xp_earned'
  | 'stars_earned'
  | 'daily_challenges_completed'
  | 'streak_days'
  | 'perfect_sessions'
  | 'fast_answers'
```

### Quest Selection Algorithm
1. Each day/week, randomly select 3 from the pool
2. Weight toward quests relevant to user's current course position
3. Never repeat the same quest two days/weeks in a row
4. At least 1 quest should be easily achievable (low target)
5. At least 1 quest should push the user (stretch goal)

### UI Location
- **Dashboard:** Quest card widget showing 3 daily quests with progress bars
- **Weekly quests:** Expandable section below daily quests
- **Completion:** Confetti animation + XP/gem reward toast
- **Chest:** Animated chest opening when all 3 daily/weekly quests completed

---

## 2. Gems Currency

### Purpose
Secondary economy that gives tangible value to engagement milestones and creates a spending loop (earn → spend → earn more to spend more).

### Earning Gems

| Source | Gems |
|--------|------|
| Daily quest completion | 5 each |
| Daily quest chest (all 3) | 15 bonus |
| Weekly quest completion | 20 each |
| Weekly quest chest (all 3) | 50 bonus |
| 3-star lesson (first time) | 10 |
| League promotion | 25 |
| Streak milestone (7 days) | 10 |
| Streak milestone (14 days) | 25 |
| Streak milestone (30 days) | 50 |
| Streak milestone (60 days) | 100 |
| Streak milestone (100 days) | 200 |
| Unit completion (first time) | 50 |

### Spending Gems

| Item | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Streak Freeze | 30 gems | Pre-purchase protection for 1 missed day |
| Streak Repair | 50 gems | Restore broken streak within 24 hours |
| Double XP (30 min) | 40 gems | 2x XP for 30 minutes |
| Profile Title | 20 gems | Unlock custom titles (e.g., "Thermal King", "Stress Master") |
| Avatar Frame | 35 gems | Decorative frame for profile avatar |

### Data Model

```typescript
interface GemsState {
  balance: number
  totalEarned: number
  transactions: GemTransaction[]
  inventory: {
    streakFreezes: number // purchased but unused
    activeTitles: string[] // unlocked title IDs
    activeFrames: string[] // unlocked frame IDs
    doubleXpExpiry: number | null // timestamp when active double XP ends
  }
}

interface GemTransaction {
  id: string
  amount: number // positive = earned, negative = spent
  source: string // e.g., 'daily_quest', 'streak_freeze_purchase'
  timestamp: number
}
```

### UI Location
- **Top bar:** Gem count next to XP (diamond icon)
- **Gem shop:** Accessible from profile or dashboard
- **Earn animations:** Gems fly to counter on earn events

---

## 3. League System

### Purpose
Weekly competitive motivation. Users earn XP and are ranked against competitors. Top performers promote to higher leagues; bottom performers demote. Creates weekly stakes and social comparison.

### League Tiers

| Tier | Name | Icon | Promotion | Demotion |
|------|------|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Bronze | 🥉 | Top 5 → Silver | — |
| 2 | Silver | 🥈 | Top 5 → Gold | Bottom 5 → Bronze |
| 3 | Gold | 🥇 | Top 5 → Diamond | Bottom 5 → Silver |
| 4 | Diamond | 💎 | Top 3 → Masters | Bottom 5 → Gold |
| 5 | Masters | 👑 | — | Bottom 3 → Diamond |

### Simulated Competitors
Since the app may not have a large user base, competitors are simulated:
- **30 competitors per league** (including the user)
- Each competitor has: display name, avatar initial, country flag
- XP accumulation follows realistic daily patterns:
  - Active users: 50-200 XP/day with variance
  - Moderate users: 20-80 XP/day
  - Light users: 0-30 XP/day
  - Some users skip days
- Competitor intensity scales with league tier (Masters competitors earn more)
- Names drawn from a pool of ~200 realistic international names

### Weekly Cycle
1. **Monday 00:00:** New league week starts, XP resets to 0
2. **During week:** All XP earned counts toward league ranking
3. **Sunday 23:59:** Week ends, promotions/demotions calculated
4. **Results screen:** Show final ranking, promotion/demotion animation

### Data Model

```typescript
interface LeagueState {
  currentTier: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
  weeklyXp: number
  weekStartDate: string // ISO date
  competitors: LeagueCompetitor[]
  lastWeekResult: {
    rank: number
    promoted: boolean
    demoted: boolean
    tier: number
  } | null
}

interface LeagueCompetitor {
  id: string
  name: string
  avatarInitial: string
  countryFlag: string
  weeklyXp: number
  dailyXpRate: number // base rate for simulation
  variance: number // randomness factor
}
```

### UI Location
- **Dashboard:** League card showing current tier, rank, and top 5
- **Full leaderboard page:** Scrollable list of all 30 competitors
- **Promotion/demotion:** Full-screen celebration or consolation animation at week's end
- **Top bar:** Small league badge icon

---

## 4. Session Continuation Hooks

### Purpose
The moment after completing a lesson is the highest-intent moment. Intercept it with personalized nudges to start the next lesson immediately.

### Hook Types (shown on lesson result screen)

1. **Proximity nudge:** "You're 1 lesson away from completing Unit 3!" (when close to unit completion)
2. **XP nudge:** "Just 30 more XP to reach Level 12!" (when close to leveling up)
3. **Quest nudge:** "Complete one more lesson to finish today's quest!" (when quest is close)
4. **League nudge:** "You're in 6th place — one more lesson could put you in the promotion zone!" (when near top 5)
5. **Streak nudge:** "Keep your 14-day streak alive — you haven't practiced enough today!" (if daily minimum not met)
6. **Double XP hook:** After completing a lesson, offer 10-minute double XP countdown for the next lesson. Visible countdown timer creates urgency.

### Priority Logic
Show at most 2 nudges. Priority order:
1. Quest completion proximity (within 1 action of completing)
2. Unit completion proximity (1-2 lessons away)
3. Level up proximity (within 50 XP)
4. League promotion proximity (within top 7, not yet top 5)
5. Double XP offer (always shown as secondary)

### UI
- Nudges appear as cards below the result summary
- "Continue" button is prominent and pre-loaded with the next lesson
- Double XP shows an animated countdown timer
- Subtle pulse animation on the continue button

---

## 5. Streak Enhancements

### Purpose
Extend the existing streak system with protection mechanics and milestone celebrations, making streaks more valuable and recoverable.

### New Features

**Streak Freeze:**
- Pre-purchased with gems (30 gems)
- User can hold up to 2 freezes at a time
- Automatically consumed if user misses a day
- Visual: Ice crystal icon overlay on streak flame
- Notification: "Your streak freeze saved your 14-day streak yesterday!"

**Streak Repair:**
- Available for 24 hours after a streak breaks
- Costs 50 gems
- Restores the streak to its previous value
- One-time offer per break (can't repair the same break twice)
- UI: Modal on first visit after streak break

**Streak Milestones:**
- Beyond existing achievements, add gem rewards:
  - 7 days → 10 gems + "Consistent" badge
  - 14 days → 25 gems + "Dedicated" badge
  - 30 days → 50 gems + "Committed" badge + special profile frame
  - 60 days → 100 gems + "Relentless" badge
  - 100 days → 200 gems + "Legendary" badge + exclusive title
- Celebration: Full-screen milestone animation with gem shower

### Data Model Additions

```typescript
interface StreakEnhancements {
  freezesOwned: number // 0-2
  freezeUsedToday: boolean
  lastStreakBreakDate: string | null // for repair window
  repairAvailable: boolean
  milestonesReached: number[] // [7, 14, 30, ...]
}
```

---

## 6. Comeback Mechanics

### Purpose
Re-engage users who've been away for 3+ days. Reduce the psychological barrier of returning after a lapse.

### Flow

1. **Detection:** If `daysSinceLastSession >= 3`, trigger comeback flow on next visit
2. **Welcome Back Screen:**
   - Friendly message: "Welcome back! We missed you."
   - Show what happened while they were away (new daily challenges, quest resets)
   - If streak broke: offer streak repair (if within 24h) or acknowledge it gently
3. **Comeback Quest Chain** (replaces daily quests for that day):
   - Quest 1: "Answer 5 questions" (very easy, warm-up)
   - Quest 2: "Complete 1 lesson" (re-establish habit)
   - Quest 3: "Get 70%+ on a session" (confidence builder)
   - Rewards are slightly higher than normal daily quests (30 XP + 10 gems each)
4. **Reduced Difficulty (optional):**
   - First session back starts with questions from topics user is strongest in
   - Gradually reintroduces harder material

### Data Model

```typescript
interface ComebackState {
  isInComebackFlow: boolean
  comebackQuestsCompleted: number
  lastSessionDate: string
  daysAway: number
}
```

## 7. Dashboard Nudge Cards

### Purpose
Surface personalized, actionable motivation on the dashboard so the user always knows what to do next and why.

### Card Types

1. **Neglected Topic:** "You haven't practiced Thermodynamics in 5 days — it's your weakest topic."
   - CTA: "Practice Now" → links to topic deep dive
2. **Achievement Proximity:** "3 more correct answers until 'Centurion' achievement!"
   - CTA: "Keep Going" → links to adaptive practice
3. **Course Progress:** "You're 60% through Unit 3 — just 4 lessons left!"
   - CTA: "Continue" → links to next lesson
4. **Quest Status:** "2/3 daily quests done — complete one more lesson to earn your chest!"
   - CTA: "View Quests" → scrolls to quest widget
5. **League Alert:** "You dropped to 7th place — 2 lessons would put you back in top 5!"
   - CTA: "Earn XP" → links to next course lesson
6. **Streak Warning:** "Don't forget — practice today to keep your 12-day streak alive!"
   - Shown after 6pm if user hasn't practiced today

### Display Rules
- Show at most 3 nudge cards at a time
- Priority: streak warning > quest proximity > league alert > course progress > achievement proximity > neglected topic
- Don't repeat the same card type two days in a row
- Dismiss button hides card for the rest of the day
- Cards appear above the existing Quick Actions grid

---

## State Management

All new state lives in a new Zustand store: `useEngagementStore`, persisted to localStorage under key `mechready-engagement`.

```typescript
interface EngagementState {
  // Gems
  gems: GemsState

  // Quests
  dailyQuests: Quest[]
  weeklyQuests: Quest[]
  dailyQuestDate: string // ISO date, for reset detection
  weeklyQuestDate: string // ISO date of Monday
  dailyChestClaimed: boolean
  weeklyChestClaimed: boolean

  // League
  league: LeagueState

  // Streak enhancements
  streak: StreakEnhancements

  // Comeback
  comeback: ComebackState

  // Nudges
  dismissedNudges: Record<string, string> // nudgeType → dismissDate

  // Double XP
  doubleXpExpiry: number | null

  // Actions
  initDailyQuests: () => void
  initWeeklyQuests: () => void
  updateQuestProgress: (key: QuestTrackingKey, value?: number, filter?: Record<string, string>) => void
  claimQuestReward: (questId: string) => void
  claimChest: (type: 'daily' | 'weekly') => void
  purchaseItem: (itemId: string) => boolean
  useStreakFreeze: () => void
  repairStreak: () => boolean
  simulateLeagueWeek: () => void
  updateLeagueXp: (xp: number) => void
  checkComebackFlow: () => void
  dismissNudge: (nudgeType: string) => void
  activateDoubleXp: () => void
}
```

### Integration Points

The engagement store must be updated from existing flows:

1. **After lesson completion** (`LessonView` / `ResultScreen`):
   - Call `updateQuestProgress('lessons_completed', 1)`
   - Call `updateLeagueXp(xpEarned)`
   - Show continuation hooks
   - Check/offer double XP

2. **After session completion** (`SessionSummary`):
   - Call `updateQuestProgress('sessions_completed', 1)`
   - Call `updateQuestProgress('questions_correct', correctCount)`
   - Update accuracy-based quests

3. **On dashboard load** (`page.tsx`):
   - Call `initDailyQuests()` (handles reset detection)
   - Call `initWeeklyQuests()` (handles reset detection)
   - Call `checkComebackFlow()`
   - Simulate league competitor XP for elapsed time
   - Render nudge cards

4. **On app load** (layout or provider):
   - Check streak freeze consumption for missed days
   - Check streak repair window

### Database Schema Additions

```sql
-- Gems ledger
CREATE TABLE gem_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Quest progress (for server-side validation)
CREATE TABLE quest_progress (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  quest_date DATE NOT NULL,
  quest_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- 'daily' | 'weekly'
  quests JSONB NOT NULL,
  chest_claimed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- League state
CREATE TABLE league_state (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  tier INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  weekly_xp INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  week_start DATE NOT NULL,
  competitors JSONB NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Streak enhancements
ALTER TABLE user_progress ADD COLUMN streak_freezes INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE user_progress ADD COLUMN gems_balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE user_progress ADD COLUMN gems_total_earned INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE user_progress ADD COLUMN streak_milestones JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
```
